## Abstract

Cognitive science has long treated mind as a computational system—an information-processing engine that models the world. Yet cognition is not born in logic but in relationship. This paper proposes a new theoretical architecture—the fiduciary model of cognition—which unifies the Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance (KMED) in its two developmental instantiations: KMED-I (Infancy) and KMED-R (Relationships). Together they trace the full moral trajectory of knowing: from the infant’s cry–response dyad, where perception first meets recognition, to the adult dialogue–conflict dyad, where knowledge is maintained through ethical reciprocity.

At the heart of the model lie three operational parameters—recognition (ρ), suppression (σ), and fiduciary containment (ϕ)—which regulate the evolution of epistemic autonomy (EA), dissonance tolerance (DT), and dependence (D). Across life, these variables form a fiduciary circuit governing whether cognition remains open and adaptive or collapses into conformity and silence. Drawing on empirical evidence from developmental and relational psychology (Ferreira et al., 2022; Guidetti et al., 2017; Jakubiak & Feeney, 2018; Pettit et al., 2024; Wang & Chen, 2023), the paper demonstrates that moral asymmetry—how power is held in trust—predicts cognitive flexibility and resilience more strongly than affective compatibility.

The unified KMED framework thereby redefines cognition as fiduciary regulation: knowing is not computation but stewardship. The mind becomes an ethical ecosystem sustained by care, candour, and transparency. This synthesis offers psychologists and philosophers a grammar linking attachment, conflict, and moral reasoning, and provides psychiatry with a model of mental injury grounded in epistemic corruption rather than affective instability. The paper concludes that a fiduciary science of mind is now within reach—one that locates intelligence not in calculation, but in trust.
